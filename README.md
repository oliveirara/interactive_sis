# Interactive SIS

This is a draft project in which you can check the arc ridgelines of elliptical sources lensed by the Singular Isothermal Sphere lens. I will add more features in the future, so keep in touch with this repo!

Part of the functions used were inspired from [Interactive Strong Lensing](https://github.com/rirze/interactive-strong-lensing) and [Adam S. Bolton's Strong Lensing Demo](http://www.physics.utah.edu/~bolton/python_lens_demo/).
